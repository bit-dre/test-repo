# GoDaddy Repos App

A React application that fetches and displays GoDaddy's GitHub repositories. I included the names as the links to click, and when clicked should present information. Structured in a simple way, did what was asked for. Data is fetched only once.


## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/bit-dre/godaddy-test.git
npm install
npm run dev


## Technologies I Used

I chose axios for making API calls because I've used it before in different projects. It handles HTTP requests in a elegant way and makes working with JSON straightforward. Plus, it has great error handling built-in. Also I used React Router to handle navigation as I've used it before. So it pretty easy to go to new pages without creating seperate HTML files.
